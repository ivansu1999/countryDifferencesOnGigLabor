## Project Description and Project Goal
The rapidly growing platform economy has raised significant discussions around labor relations and labor rights that are different from traditional employment. Platform work, namely paid work mediated by online platforms, (Joyce et al. 2019), has posed various challenges to “standard employment relationship” regarding workplace regulation, labor protection, contractual relations of employment, etc. The huge debate mainly revolves around the question of to what extent platform work is beneficial or exploitative to ordinary workers; and further whether or not platform workers should be recognized as formal employees and enjoy basic labor protection, and ultimately, are gig workers “independent contractor” or “formal employees”? To date, a large amount of attention from the public, social media, academia, and the government, has focused on exploring different platforms, such as Uber, which offers us rich information to develop a project to better understand the geography of platform work “conundrum”. Against this background, our project aims to present broad geographical information on the platform economy and to visualize some of the key events that facilitate a general rethinking of labor relations in the platform economy. The target audience would be professionals involved in labor legislation, labor rights activists, governors in labor regulation, the public who care about platform economy, and scholars/researchers who want to have overview ideas on related topics. 

## The Debate of Platform Economy
The debate on wether or not a gig worker is an independent contractor or a formal employee is increasing with the emergence of a gig worker economy. There is a lot of confusion on how these workers are classified. However, if you look at how the IRS defines different types of workers and contractors, it gives us more clarity on how they are ranked nationally. An independent worker is defined as an individual who perform services without an employee legally controlling the quality and details of your services (IRS). Whereas a Common-Law-Empolyee is determined as a worker who has a employer-employee relations with the employer controlling the financial, behavioral, and relational control over your services that you provide (IRS). Since the groundbasis of a gig worker is how “an individual runs a business and provides services to other companies or individuals (Gig Worker).” Under these assumptions, it would seem evident that gig workers are employees under the companies that they provide. However, the US Department of Labor under the Trump administration argued that the employer does not have much control over the gig worker, that the gig worker has a flexible work schedule and has the freedom to leave the working relationship at any time, and that the workers’ services were not integrated with the business’s services. As such that this regime classified gig workers as independent contractors (Armstrong Law Firm). However, the Biden administration is now proposing to repeal this classification. “While independent contractors have an important role in our economy, we have seen in many cases that employers misclassify their employees as independent contractors, particularly among our nation’s most vulnerable workers,” said Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh (PBS). 
For example, according to the US Beaureau of Labor Statistics, 14% of gig workers received less than the $7.25 an hour, 62% of gig workers have lost pay due to technical difficulties clocking in or out, and about twice as much of gig workers 32%, compared to W2 sector workers 18% reported it is very difficult to cover expenses and pay bills. (EPI). So much is still to be discovered about the gig worker economy and its workers in the US. The US BLS is in the works to uncover the realities of how gig workers; the statistics they uncovered in these surveys already showcase the grim facts that these workers face, and further supports the incentive to support this proposal. The national debate on what a gig worker should be is a hot topic, and we will be exploring the international debate on this topic as well.
